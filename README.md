# MERN Advanced Authentication
This project implements an advanced authentication and authorization system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It features secure user registration, login, password reset, role-based access control (RBAC), and protected routes using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

### Features
- **User Registration:** Secure user sign-up with password hashing using bcrypt.
- **User Login:** JWT-based authentication for secure login and session management.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assign roles to users and control access to different resources based on user roles (e.g., Admin, User).
- **Protected Routes:** Restrict access to specific routes based on user authentication and roles.
- **Password Reset:** Password recovery system via email.
- **MongoDB Integration:** MongoDB is used for storing user credentials and roles.
- **React Frontend:** A user-friendly interface for interacting with authentication features.
